## Project Motivation <a name='motivation'></a>
In January 2011 Starbucks released its mobile app through which customers receive custom offers of various types (BOGO, discounts, etc.). The goal of this project is to understand which are the users that are most responsive to these offers. We were provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app which we used to build a predictive model.

## Files Description <a name='files'></a>
* data
  * profile.json: contains information about the user such as age, gender, and income
  * portfolio.json: contains information about the offers such as type, duration, reward, minimum required spend to complete the offer, channels
  * transcript.json: contains records about user's purchases and interactions with the offers
* requirements.txt: contains a list of all python libraries used in the project
